# NQURM (Not Quite Unlimited Register Machine)
## An unlimited register machine simulation library written in Rust.

## Features
NQURM can currently
1. simulate URM programs
2. and encode URM programs as integers (along with related suport functions).

## Goals
- Create a simple CLI application to run URM programs using serde.
- Provide some primitive recursive functions to concatinate with, perhaps using a feature.
